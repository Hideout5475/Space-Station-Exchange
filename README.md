# The Space Station Exchange
The year is 2096. Humans have gained access to travel at 90% the speed of light. We have found life throughout the universe.
We made a universal agreement between all life forms so we can live in peace and keep advancing as a society, hopefully to prove the existence of other universes and colonizing them.
At this point we have advanced to where the literal laws of physics are stopping us from becoming Gods. Hopefully we can find a universe with less stict laws of physics to reach what we want.

The United Universe (UU) did break off into many nations, luckily you are located in the biggest, safest of them all.

# What does this all mean?
You work at a space station, researching and crafting fuel cells for passerbyers, both humans and aliens alike, and exchanging goods. You're research in fuel cells with help power all of life to colonize any universe growing our power.
